## Welcome to InjectorHelper Pages

**Injector Helper** is a core components that interact with different versions of iTunes. Because the changes to the iTunes version will cause the Inject logic to change different with previous version, so the **Injector Helper** and iTunes iteration cycles are the same.

### How to use

**Injector Helper** exposes a set of interfaces for client to use and all interations with iTunes are done internally, which are transparent to the client.
